<b>A Must Vist</b>
</h3>

<p>Paris is known for its passages, many of which dates back to the 18th century.There are so many hidden passages and archways in Paris but most of these are from my number one favourite, and arguably the most beautiful passage in Paris: the Galerie Vivienne.</p>

<p class="passage_intro">
  Built in the 1820s in Paris 2, near the Palais Royal, Galerie Vivienne is one of the most beautiful covered passages in Paris, well known for the elegance of its boutiques.

  The Galerie Colbert was built in 1826, Galerie's artistic refinements, its glass roof, marble columns and various paintings and statues of the interior distinguish its from other passages.

<h4>
  WHAT TO EXPECT?
</h4>

<p>In one of the chicest travel destinations</p>

<p><u>Language:</u> The official language in France is French.</p>

<p><u>Currency:</u> The currency in France, 1 Euro equals 1.05 United States Dollars (updated on Dec 5, 8:23 PM UTC).</p>

<p><u>Credit Cards and ATMs:</u> If you see a blue CB logo (Carte Bleue Visa/MasterCard), the shop takes international Visa and MasterCards. It is a bit of a hassle to find places that accept American Express in France; however, ATMs are easy to find. </p>

<p><u>Travel Adapter:</u> France has two associated plug types, types C and E. The standard voltage operated is 230 V, and the normal frequency is 50Hz. Hence the best type of electrical outlet adapter to buy for use in Paris would be type C & E, or you can buy a universal adapter, but make sure it has surge protection.</p>

<p><u>Safety:</u> France is generally considered a safe country to travel. However, just like in other big cities, pickpockets and tourist scams are common, especially in the capital city of Paris; it is pretty safe compared to other European cities.</p>
